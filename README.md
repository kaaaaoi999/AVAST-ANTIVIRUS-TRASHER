 # AVAST ANTIVIRUS TRASHER
 Trashing the worst antivirus
 Using VBScript We will Trash Avst Antivirus because it did not remove any unwated programs after installation and customizing the shortcut, To access the reporter it must be set as "C:/Program Files/Avast Software/Application/AvastUI.exe", so nothing affects deleting or changing the shortcut, if not, trash avast for it, or any case trash avast.
 This is an standalone Windows app because the creator has VBS To EXE Converter: You can also convert your VBScript files to exe with this converter for free, 
Avast antivirus is a product from Czech, its website is scribbled with a 5-year old, also bad design on the product, You can chill and feel the trash of Avast Antivirus By Opening the TRASER app, minimizing it, opening your browser, heading to the avast website, now you can listen avast getting trashed by the app saying: "You know what, avast antivirus is a dog shit!" multiple times.
